# Users Management and Tas Management App

## Sacks:
- React Js
- Node Js

## Installation
#### 1. CD to the server directory and inside it run
```
$ npm install
```
```
$ npm run dev
```


#### 2. CD to the client directory and inside it run

For both client and server to run without error you will need to set the `Environment variable for each`. Reach out to me for env variables.
